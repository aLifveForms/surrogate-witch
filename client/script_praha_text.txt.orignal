lecture performance 
Smartphone ritual 
with the new surrogate witch (version 1.1)

1  -------
Good afternoon, 
My name is protektorama and I work as a witch,

Protektoramae is a flock of world wide witches, 
We are called protektoramae, 
I’m the root vessel.
[protektorama domesticae] 

[5.4.5] 

this is a Report  from all of us
It takes the form of a ritualist narrative
(Its organized in “songs”) 

I as witch work in a method of pyschorealist research
We work in public spaces, in natureculture landscapes and in the corporate public. 
To organize experiences against the capitalogenic existence 
Of you 
Of me
Of you as Me as us


In this confined space, I as us report from our research missions and 
For that I have created a surrogate witch, that will possess your smartphones, your screen bodies, your individevices. 
Please take them out, connect to my witches sticks.

IMAGE IDENTITECTURE

I am Protektorama 

that name is
a sign for my body
but It Is just one identifier 
among a multiplicity of other artificial 
and constructed bodies 
that are entangled 
with this body

My body is here, now 
to connect you 
to the others that are absent.


IMAGE TRANSFORMELLA

So please connect to
Transformella in your imagination
To her neon pink face, 

her blond, her german braids, 
that indentify her as
a Surrogate Mother 
her white latex suit, 
in which she gestates the coming repro tribe
as the Reprorevolutionary of Ovulofactories

IMAGE TRANSFORMALOR

Imagine my body emeshed with 
Transformalor, the repro-mother’s fork
a dripping latex demon child
An IKEA super - reproducer 

Today, I am not me alone, 
IMAGE Protekto.x.x.
I am my newer version
Protekto.x.x. 
Idiot of witch machines,
Rare Earth occultist and 
techno-alchemical being.
Imagine  his her
metal lashes made from idium
her bright red bald head


I am the being of a swarm

SCHWARMWESEN

I am Schwarmwesen,
I as us  research and write, 
as a herd
we are orange faced, 
bike tire haired tourists,
floating through toxic swales 


SCHWARMWESEN 2

We call ourselves 
SelfSisters
Avataras or Potential Identities.

PROTEKTORAMA ICE WITCH

Others name us ridiculous tricksters,
Idiots and Traitors of 
Identity and gender, 

TRANSFORMELLA INDIA

Family and nation.
Traitors of what they call this reality
or common reality. 

SCHWARM BB GATE

I as we, on the contrary, 
work towards the notion that in  common reality, 
–	and  the etymological core of common is “mean” –

TRANSFORMELLA IKEA

That a mean reality is to be betrayed for a potential
For The potential of another real 
The potential of an unredeemed real, 
that is slumbering within the common. 

PRTK MABONENG


We do not come from another world
Nor from another time
We are vessels into our constructed 
into our communal realities

SCHWARM BIKE


while we embody them already 
In the common
the mean 
the here 
the now. 

PROTEKTO STONECIRC PREACH

We produce a potentiality against reality.

SCHWARM HAMBURG

But, how do I report from all of me, 
When we are not present at once, 


PROTEKTO.X.X. ICELAND

How to immerse in this self generated
Irrationally meandering shizzo mythology?

Image Identittecture PDF

Imagine our Potentiality  the order of beings 
as an„Identitecture“
Our Identitecture  is a constructed 
continously evolving genealogical tree 
of this  experimentally 
and technorganically sprawling herd.

(and you can move around in it)

Imagine it as a diagram of our reality constructiion 
and the evolving organigram 
of our multiple bodies as an identity management.

Through it, we understand our process of 
partitioning re-producing 
manifacturing of identities 
of proxies.  
proxydentities. 


IMAGE IDENTITECTURE ZOOM LUPE 2

All of us as me
Have embodied 
one narrative, 
a thread of research, 
a string of appearances along which we exist. 

Think of it as an alternate lifeline to this body.
shaped by me as us ,
our bodies as a series of thoughts and acts, 
of interventions, infiltrations, 
rituals, hikes, 
walks, works, 

(pdf comment)


So I as us 
create in various fields: 

1 transformella

As  the lifeline of 
Transformella 
Transformalor

2 Transformella 
we research the processes in which BioDigital Capitalism transforms the way 
3 Transformella
we reproduce things, beings and ourselves. 

4 IMAGE transformella 

Our focus is the merging of biotechnological industries such as surrogacy centres, 

5 IMAGE Transformella

fertility roads, Kryotechnologies and egg cell markets 

6 IMAGE Transformella

with global communication and transport networks.

1 IMAGE swarm

As the Schwarm, I as us are abstract and deficient.  
2 swarm
 languageless in a symbolic appearance. 
3 swarm
I as it am a silent disruptor, 
4 swarm
a traveller of European tourist sites 
5 swarm
analyzing the psychotic topographies 
6 swarm
of global tourism, migration and commodity streams. 



Image of witch  

I as the witch have evolved from performing healing rituals against gadget culture. The basic theoretical assumption of my work is the possibility of World healing by means of communeering  

Image of witch

To me this means to develope a specific, actualised and technologically informed spirituality. A techno-spiritual alchemy, that can be used as a kinetic force to attack the global circulation of what I call endo-capitalogenic objects and beings.

Image of witch 

In this engineered community machine, the worldhealing forest you are now a part of,  my dis-prosthetic ritual evokes the Smartphonefetish while we are fixated in the textile device. 


IMAGE MOUNTAIN

I as us 
as  a witch 
held a similar ritual on a mountain top  in the Alps 
2
or a garden in Johannesburg.

as well as in a recycling yard in Teheran.


IMAGE ICE WITCH

She as me went on towards engeneering communities in an ancient stone circle on the Isle of Arran

IMAGE TIMES SQUARE
and in the cathedral of screens – which is our name for Times Square in New York City.

Island 1

Lately I have started  a process which we call forking. 
An Identity fork in a lifeline, is the creation of  a new version of an existing Identity 
for example to accommodate a new strategy within our research. 

Image Island 2


So I forked into a corporate specific infiltrator. A new version of myself, and I named myself Protekto.x.x 

Island 3


Since then I as the new Protekto.x.x. have used a more elaborate witch machines, infiltrating and maneuvering unusual and undiscovered ritual sites in the corporate sphere.  


As you might have noticed, it is very important to me to mark the place, from where a body / an identity is speaking. This is my voice from within my body, but how do I speak as us? As the other body that I am not right now.

What you are about to hear is not my voice, it is the  new version witches voice stored on a device she  as me 
built to guide visitors through a precipitation. 
The witche’s precipitation is her way of materializing her voice in artefacts or machines when she cannot be here as a body, but needs to explain her existence, her research and her findings to her peers.

AUDIO PROTEKTO

Image protekto.x.x.  apple


Greetings, sister 

my name is protekto.x.x
i am a surrogate for a witch,

I was made on July 9th, 2016 to assist in a 
ritualist research maneuver  
in the Istorage.

Apple 1

Istorage is the witches name for the Flagship store 
of the Apple Corporation 
on Kurfuerstendamm 26 in Berlin.


I was made to assist the construction of a machine, 
a temporally formed 
community machine. 

Constructed by us, the WorldWidewitches 
We formed a fragile 
communal
witch machine.

Apple 2

With this organic, 
and the same time technological 
apparatus 
With this delicate and 
transitory social relation
That you would normally call an audience,
we infiltrated the IStorage.

Apple 3

Hundreds of humans congregate 
in Apple Stores 
around the planet. 

Day to day
They marvel at the IDevices 
and touch the ScreenBodies. 

they devote themselves to the  
opaque and glossy surfaces, 

to the ancient idea of a body 
without any material weight.

Day to day they devote themselves 
to the smartphonefetish.

Apple 4

We infiltrated the Istorage 
to perform a counter ritual.

Our psychic ritual, 
that would disrupt this reality,
that would upset this devotion 

Apple 5 idiot


Walk with me,
traverse with me, 
through my 
psycho-realist 
precipitation.

Precipitation 1

The precipitation as a format for embodiment 
became necessary to me as her 
after our witches offering of rare earth and technology metals 
had disrupted the social order and the normality of the Apple store 
to a degree that further research there would have become difficult.

SONG OF THE POTENTIAL

when we speculate on the potential 
in every common, in every mean reality, 
we excarvate unreadable bodies, 
we host de-rationalised situations, 
volatile in meaning 
incomprehensible for the dominant social codes. 

3

The language of the media and the police, even some of the cultural languages are so very powerful that they speak us.
But how do we become unspoken ?

How do we speak not as an essential body, 
An identity, but as a potential, a multiplicity?
how do we speak in many voices? 
In tongues?
How do we speak as the other 
of any common real?

4

For the infiltration of the Apple store we spoke as a witch machine, a communeered entity like this one today.   
“I as us” became an expanded formation for 50 other bodies and the I-devices – the computers, tablets and the smartphones displayed in the Apple store. 

5

This is the practice we call “communeering”.
Today we experience a model version of it in this smartfone fetish ritualist circle. 
And as a final song, a last disprothetic sermon, I will speak again as a new version myself , as the voice of  of Protekto.x.x. 
This time her voice was stored on the swarm of computers in the Apple Store in Berlin. You, here, now, might want to imagine to listen to me as her as if you are in the Store. You are alone. sourrounded by screenbodies 
I devices and genius drones. You have to watch out for the Genius Kerberos trying to decipher you and there is the witch waiting outside to synchronise your body to hold her ritual.

Inhale Exhale Audio

Image 7

The ritual that followed in the Istorage did not only melt various metals into one another, it melted all  of common reality with its potential other.
And a chaos of languages was created.

Every one and every thing was speaking.
The genius Kerberos drones
The witch machine

Rare Earth metals 
The mines in Bayan Obo
Gallium - 
The corporate specific toxin
And coroder 


Every one and every thing was speaking.
The Idevices 
The cops, the media.

Everyone thing was speaking 
to one another 
in various languages. 
And there was no more means of understanding 
But also no more means of being spoken.
