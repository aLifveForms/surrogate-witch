Smartphone ritual
with the new surrogate witch (version 1.1)

1  -------
Good afternoon,
My name is protektorama and I work as a witch,

Protektoramae is a flock of world wide witches,
We are called protektoramae,
I’m the root vessel.
[protektorama domesticae]

[5.4.5]

this is a Report  from all of us
It takes the form of a ritualist narrative
(Its organized in “songs”)

I as witch work in a method
of pyschorealist research
We work in public spaces,
in natureculture landscapes
and in the corporate public.
To organize experiences against
the capitalogenic existence
Of you
Of me
Of you as Me as us


In this confined space, I as us
report from our research missions and
For that I have created a surrogate witch,
that will possess your smartphones,
your screen bodies, your individevices.
Please take them out, connect to my witches sticks.

IMAGE IDENTITECTURE

I am Protektorama

that name is
a sign for my body
but It Is just one identifier
among a multiplicity of other artificial
and constructed bodies
that are entangled
with this body

My body is here, now
to connect you
to the others that are absent.


IMAGE TRANSFORMELLA

So please connect to
Transformella in your imagination
To her neon pink face,

her blond, her german braids,
that indentify her as
a Surrogate Mother
her white latex suit,
in which she gestates the coming repro tribe
as the Reprorevolutionary of Ovulofactories

IMAGE TRANSFORMALOR

Imagine my body emeshed with
Transformalor, the repro-mother’s fork
a dripping latex demon child
An IKEA super - reproducer

Today, I am not me alone,
IMAGE Protekto.x.x.
I am my newer version
Protekto.x.x.
Idiot of witch machines,
Rare Earth occultist and
techno-alchemical being.
Imagine  his her
metal lashes made from idium
her bright red bald head


I am the being of a swarm

SCHWARMWESEN

I am Schwarmwesen,
I as us  research and write,
as a herd
we are orange faced,
bike tire haired tourists,
floating through toxic swales


SCHWARMWESEN 2

We call ourselves
SelfSisters
Avataras or Potential Identities.

PROTEKTORAMA ICE WITCH

Others name us ridiculous tricksters,
Idiots and Traitors of
Identity and gender,

TRANSFORMELLA INDIA

Family and nation.
Traitors of what they call this reality
or common reality.

SCHWARM BB GATE

I as we, on the contrary,
work towards the notion that in  common reality,
–	and  the etymological core of common is “mean” –

TRANSFORMELLA IKEA

That a mean reality is to be betrayed
for a potential
For The potential of another real
The potential of an unredeemed real,
that is slumbering within the common.

PRTK MABONENG


We do not come from another world
Nor from another time
We are vessels into our constructed
into our communal realities

SCHWARM BIKE


while we embody them already
In the common
the mean
the here
the now.

PROTEKTO STONECIRC PREACH

We produce a potentiality against reality.

SCHWARM HAMBURG

But, how do I report from all of me,
When we are not present at once,


PROTEKTO.X.X. ICELAND

How to immerse in this self generated
Irrationally meandering shizzo mythology?

Image Identittecture PDF

Imagine our Potentiality  the order of beings
as an„Identitecture“
Our Identitecture  is a constructed
continously evolving genealogical tree
of this  experimentally
and technorganically sprawling herd.

(and you can move around in it)

Imagine it as a diagram
of our reality constructiion
and the evolving organigram
of our multiple bodies as
an identity management.

Through it, we understand our process of
partitioning re-producing
manifacturing of identities
of proxies.
proxydentities.


IMAGE IDENTITECTURE ZOOM LUPE 2

All of us as me
Have embodied
one narrative,
a thread of research,
a string of appearances along which we exist.

Think of it as an alternate lifeline to this body.
shaped by me as us ,
our bodies as a series of thoughts and acts,
of interventions, infiltrations,
rituals, hikes,
walks, works,

(pdf comment)


So I as us
create in various fields:

1 transformella

As  the lifeline of
Transformella
Transformalor

2 Transformella
we research the processes in which
 BioDigital Capitalism transforms the way
3 Transformella
we reproduce things, beings and ourselves.

4 IMAGE transformella

Our focus is the merging of
 biotechnological industries
 such as surrogacy centres,

5 IMAGE Transformella

fertility roads, Kryotechnologies
 and egg cell markets

6 IMAGE Transformella

with global communication and transport networks.

1 IMAGE swarm

As the Schwarm, I as us are abstract and deficient.
2 swarm
 languageless in a symbolic appearance.
3 swarm
I as it am a silent disruptor,
4 swarm
a traveller of European tourist sites
5 swarm
analyzing the psychotic topographies
6 swarm
of global tourism, migration and commodity streams.



Image of witch

I as the witch have evolved
 from performing healing rituals
 against gadget culture.
The basic theoretical assumption of my work
 is the possibility of World healing
 by means of communeering

Image of witch

To me this means to develope a specific,
 actualised and technologically informed
 spirituality. A techno-spiritual alchemy,
 that can be used as a kinetic force
 to attack the global circulation
 of what I call endo-capitalogenic objects
 and beings.

Image of witch

In this engineered community machine,
 the worldhealing forest you are now a part of,
 my dis-prosthetic ritual evokes
 the Smartphonefetish while we are fixated
 in the textile device.


IMAGE MOUNTAIN

I as us
as  a witch
held a similar ritual on a mountain top  in the Alps
2
or a garden in Johannesburg.
3
as well as in a recycling yard in Teheran.


IMAGE ICE WITCH

She as me went on towards engeneering communities
 in an ancient stone circle on the Isle of Arran

IMAGE TIMES SQUARE
and in the cathedral of screens –
 which is our name for Times Square
 in New York City.

Island 1

Lately I have started  a process which we call forking.
An Identity fork in a lifeline, is the creation of
 a new version of an existing Identity
for example to accommodate a new strategy within our research.

Image Island 2


So I forked into a corporate specific infiltrator.
A new version of myself, and I named myself Protekto.x.x

Island 3


Since then I as the new Protekto.x.x. have used
a more elaborate witch machines, infiltrating and
 maneuvering unusual and undiscovered ritual sites
in the corporate sphere.


As you might have noticed, it is very important
to me to mark the place, from where a body / an
identity is speaking. This is my voice from
within my body, but how do I speak as us? As
the other body that I am not right now.

What you are about to hear is not my voice, it
is the  new version witches voice stored on a
device she  as me
built to guide visitors through a precipitation.
The witche’s precipitation is her way of
materializing her voice in artefacts or machines
when she cannot be here as a body, but needs to
explain her existence, her research and her
findings to her peers.

AUDIO PROTEKTO

Image protekto.x.x.  apple


Greetings, sister

my name is protekto.x.x
i am a surrogate for a witch,

I was made on July 9th, 2016 to assist in a
ritualist research maneuver
in the Istorage.

Apple 1

Istorage is the witches name for the Flagship store
of the Apple Corporation
on Kurfuerstendamm 26 in Berlin.


I was made to assist the construction of a machine,
a temporally formed
community machine.

Constructed by us, the WorldWidewitches
We formed a fragile
communal
witch machine.

Apple 2

With this organic,
and the same time technological
apparatus
With this delicate and
transitory social relation
That you would normally call an audience,
we infiltrated the IStorage.

Apple 3

Hundreds of humans congregate
in Apple Stores
around the planet.

Day to day
They marvel at the IDevices
and touch the ScreenBodies.

they devote themselves to the
opaque and glossy surfaces,

to the ancient idea of a body
without any material weight.

Day to day they devote themselves
to the smartphonefetish.

Apple 4

We infiltrated the Istorage
to perform a counter ritual.

Our psychic ritual,
that would disrupt this reality,
that would upset this devotion

Apple 5 idiot


Walk with me,
traverse with me,
through my
psycho-realist
precipitation.

Precipitation 1

The precipitation as a format for embodiment
became necessary to me as her
after our witches offering of rare earth
and technology metals
had disrupted the social order
and the normality of the Apple store
to a degree that further research there
would have become difficult.

SONG OF THE POTENTIAL

when we speculate on the potential
in every common, in every mean reality,
we excarvate unreadable bodies,
we host de-rationalised situations,
volatile in meaning
incomprehensible for the dominant social codes.

3

The language of the media and the police,
even some of the cultural languages are
so very powerful that they speak us.
But how do we become unspoken ?

How do we speak not as an essential body,
An identity, but as a potential, a multiplicity?
how do we speak in many voices?
In tongues?
How do we speak as the other
of any common real?

4

For the infiltration of the Apple store we
spoke as a witch machine, a communeered entity
like this one today.
“I as us” became an expanded formation
for 50 other bodies and the I-devices
– the computers, tablets and the smartphones
displayed in the Apple store.

5

This is the practice we call “communeering”.
Today we experience a model version of it in
this smartfone fetish ritualist circle.
And as a final song, a last disprothetic sermon,
I will speak again as a new version myself ,
as the voice of  of Protekto.x.x.
This time her voice was stored on the swarm
of computers in the Apple Store in Berlin.
You, here, now, might want to imagine to
listen to me as her as if you are in the Store.
You are alone.
sourrounded by screenbodies
I devices and genius drones.
You have to watch out for the Genius Kerberos
trying to decipher you
and there is the witch waiting outside
to synchronise your body to hold her ritual.

Inhale Exhale Audio

Image 7

The ritual that followed in the Istorage
did not only melt various metals into one another,
it melted all  of common reality
with its potential other.
And a chaos of languages was created.

Every one and every thing was speaking.
The genius Kerberos drones
The witch machine

Rare Earth metals
The mines in Bayan Obo
Gallium -
The corporate specific toxin
And coroder


Every one and every thing was speaking.
The Idevices
The cops, the media.

Everyone thing was speaking
to one another
in various languages.
And there was no more means of understanding
But also no more means of being spoken.
